Introduction
Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. This repository aims to provide a clear understanding of MLR, with practical examples and tools to implement these techniques effectively.
Examples
We have included several examples to demonstrate the application of multiple linear regression:

Basic MLR: A simple example to understand the core concepts.
Feature Selection: Techniques to select the most important features.
Model Evaluation: Methods to evaluate the performance of your MLR model.
